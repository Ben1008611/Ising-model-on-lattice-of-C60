# Ising-model-on-lattice-of-C60
This project aims to find the partition function and ground state degeneracy of AF Ising model on lattice of Buckyball. We provided several numerical method based on tensor networks, quasi quantum circuit, and Wang-Landau Monte Carlo method. We have also obtained the analytical solutions of the problems, and found a way to count the ground state degeneracy.
